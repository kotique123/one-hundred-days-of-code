# one-hundred-days-of-code
My own one hundred days of code challenge

In this challenge I am going to solve at least one coding problem a day for a period of one hundred days
using mostly Golang beacuse it is an easy to use, yet performant, language that can be used to solve
different problems.

As of today's date, I am temporairly pausing my work on this project due to high academic overload. It's been
a good experience to work on it every day and post my solutions here, but, unfortunatelly, I have to dedicate
my time to different things.
